    <p>Review: I tried this as written, did some baked and some with the outside dipped in panko. The panko added a much needed crunch to these.. The ones without the panko, even fried ones never got crunchy. Make sure you add lots of salt and pepper</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cooked turkey</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and baking powder together in a bowl (mixture should foam). Mix turkey, flour, egg, salt, and black pepper into water mixture. Form mixture into bite-sized nuggets.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Fry nuggets in hot vegetable oil until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
